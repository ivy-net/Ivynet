# General information

* After login change the ownership of the '/opt/eigen' directory, if you plan to build any programs.
```
sudo chown -R $USER /opt/eigen

```
* The `/opt/eigen/bin` directory is added to the $PATH variable, so it's worth to drop the `ivynet-cli` there.

_There are more info in the MOTD section._
_This section is also printed after login (as MOTD)._
