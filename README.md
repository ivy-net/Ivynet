# The Ivynet CLI tool

https://ivynet.dev/

Ivynet is building the operating system for EigenLayer - where EigenLayer, and underneath it, LRTs, facilitate an efficient use of restaked Ethereum, Ivynet facilitates an efficient use of compute in order to maxmize yield from that staked Eth.

With this cli, that begins with calculations determining whether a specific AVS is worth the compute it demands, and then it helps in deploying that AVS. 

## Features

- Import, create, and password protect your keys
- Grab information from mainnet and holesky testnet on operators and stakers
- Grab information on your computer/server in relation to AVS's node requirements
- Register as an operator or staker (Soon)
- Deploy any AVS with one command after utilizing the setup function (Soon - EigenDA coming first)
